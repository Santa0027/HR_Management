- **Database**: SQLite with test data
- **CORS**: Configured for mobile app access
- **JWT Authentication**: Properly configured

### Test Data Created
- **Test User**: 
  - Email: `driver@hrmanagement.com`
  - Password: `driver123`
  - User ID: `5`
  - Driver ID: `3`

- **Test Company**: "Test Transport Company"
- **Test Vehicle**: "Test Bus" (ABC-1234)
- **Test Location**: "Test Office Location"
  - Coordinates: 24.7136, 46.6753 (Riyadh)
  - Radius: 100 meters

## 📱 Mobile App Testing

### Prerequisites
1. Flutter app is running (`flutter run --debug`)
2. Django server is running (`python manage.py runserver`)
3. Both are accessible from the same network

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Login Test
```
Email: driver@hrmanagement.com
Password: driver123
Expected: Successful login with driver profile
```

#### 2. Attendance Check-in Test
```
Location: Within 100m of 24.7136, 46.6753
Expected: Successful check-in with location validation
```

#### 3. Biometric Setup Test
```
After successful login, enable biometric authentication
Expected: Credentials stored securely for future logins
```

## 🔍 API Endpoints Verified

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/login/` - ✅ Working
- `GET /auth/me/` - ✅ Working
- `POST /auth/refresh/` - ✅ Ready

### Attendance
- `GET /attendance/current-day/{driver_id}/` - ✅ Working
- `POST /attendance/login/` - ✅ Working
- `GET /attendance/?driver={driver_id}` - ✅ Ready

### Locations
- `GET /checkin-locations/` - ✅ Working

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Production Deployment
1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Update API base URL in mobile app
   - Configure production database
   - Set up proper SSL certificates

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement proper user registration flow
   - Add password reset functionality
   - Configure production JWT settings

3. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Add photo capture for check-in/out
   - Implement push notifications
   - Add offline mode support

### For Development
1. **Dynamic Driver ID**
   - Replace hardcoded driver ID (3) with dynamic lookup
   - Create API endpoint to get driver ID from user ID

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Add network connectivity checks
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Add user-friendly error messages
