## Debug Information:

The attendance dialog now includes debug logging:
- `AttendanceDialog: Starting camera capture...`
- `AttendanceDialog: Camera permission status: [status]`
- `AttendanceDialog: Opening camera...`
- `AttendanceDialog: Photo captured successfully: [path]`

## Manual Testing:

1. Open the app
2. Go to attendance screen

If camera fails, check the debug logs for specific error messages.
